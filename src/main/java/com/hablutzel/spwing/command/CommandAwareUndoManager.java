/**
 * An undo manager that is aware of {@link ChangeCommand} instances.
 * The {@link ChangeCommand} provides a base capability for changes
 * that are triggered by an action and may impact the UI directly. During
 * the execution of a {@link ChangeCommand}, Swing generated undoable
 * events are ignored. For example, if you have a button that recalculates
 * and changes the text of a {@link javax.swing.text.JTextComponent} subclass,
 * using a {@link ChangeCommand} will ensure that the undo commands will
 * undo the changes atomically, rather than as individual text field actions.
