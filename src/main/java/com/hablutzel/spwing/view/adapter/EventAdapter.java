/**
 * Event adapters are used to associate Spwing
 * {@link Invoker} instances to AWT component events.
 * In the Spwing model, events are given names; the
 * names of AWT events are the same as the name of the
 * method that would be called on the event listener in the
 * AWT native system. For example, a {@link java.awt.event.MouseListener#mouseClicked(MouseEvent)}
 * event will be translated into an event named "mouseClicked",
 * {@link java.awt.event.TextListener#textValueChanged(TextEvent)} to
 * "textValueChanged", etc. Exceptions to this rule are rare and
 * only when there are conflicts - e.g. {@link java.awt.event.HierarchyBoundsListener#ancestorMoved(HierarchyEvent)}
 * is mapped to "hierarchyAncestorMoved" in order to avoid conflicts
 * with the more Swing specific on from {@link javax.swing.JComponent#addAncestorListener(AncestorListener)}
