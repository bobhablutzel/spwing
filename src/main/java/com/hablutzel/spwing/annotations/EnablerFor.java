/**
 * EnablerFor annotates a method to be an enabler method
 * for a command. This method does not have to be in the
 * same class as the handler for the command; for example
 * a model class might provide functionality to determine
 * when the model needs to be saved, but leave the default
 * save command processing in place.<br>
 * The method must return a boolean value which will
 * be used to determine if the handler method is active
 * or not. Note that an inactive handler method will
 * mean the command is disabled; there is no provision
 * currently for delegating an inactive command in one
 * handler to an active handler lower in the handler stack.<br>
 * For the command "cmdXXX", the default name of an enabler
 * method is "enableXXX".
